# calculator

Calculator app using gtk4 and c , mainly so that i learn gtk4 and some OOPS concepts

day 1 : instead of repeating code for each button , init each button in a array and add them and was testing how memory would move around if i passed it using gpointer for future use

day2 : tried very complex ways to add chars to buffer wihtout using built in methods to the objects i use , fixed that and some memory allocation that i messed up and forgot
